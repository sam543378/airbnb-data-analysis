# Airbnb Data Cleaning and Visualization

## Description

This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing Airbnb dataset information sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes details such as location, pricing, reviews, availability, and host information. The primary goal is to prepare the data for insightful analysis by addressing null values, outliers, and redundant information, and creating meaningful visualizations to answer key business questions. The project also demonstrates how the cleaned data and visualizations can be leveraged for business insights.

## Visualization:
Answering key business questions through graphs and charts.                                 
Scripts are in the Data cleaning and Visualization in python folder. Execute them step by step to replicate the cleaning and visualization process.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis includes visualizations created with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium. Here are some key visualizations:

1.**Bar Plots**:
Top 10 Hosts by Number of Listings: 
Identifies hosts with the highest number of listings.

Average Price by Neighbourhood: Compares average pricing for the top 10 neighbourhoods.

Most Active Neighbourhoods: Highlights neighbourhoods with the most listings.

2.**Box and Violin Plots**:
Availability by Room Type: Displays the range of availability for different room types.

Price Distribution by Room Type: Shows price variation for different room types.

3.**Geographical Maps**:

Listing Locations: A Folium map plotting all listing locations with interactive markers. 
Markers are color-coded by room type (e.g., blue for Entire Home/Apt, green for Private Room, orange for Shared Room) and include detailed pop-ups showing the host name, neighborhood, room type, and price."

Improve satisfaction by focusing on high-demand areas and high-scoring properties.

- Seasonal Strategy:
Align marketing efforts with seasonal trends in availability and reviews.

## Key Findings

- Neighbourhood Trends:

The most active neighbourhoods and their pricing trends were identified.
Neighbourhood groups influence pricing significantly.

- Room Type Preferences:

Certain room types have higher average availability and more competitive pricing.

- Host Insights:

Hosts with verified profiles have a larger share of the listings.

### Review Dynamics:

Reviews over time reveal seasonal peaks, aligning with high availability periods.
